The user SVC_LOANMGR@EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL has the DS-Replication-Get-Changes and the DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All privilege on the domain EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL.
These two privileges allow a principal to perform a DCSync attack.

You may perform a dcsync attack to get the password hash of an arbitrary principal using mimikatz:
lsadump::dcsync /domain:testlab.local /user:Administrator
You can also perform the more complicated ExtraSids attack to hop domain trusts. For information on this see the blog post by harmj0y in the references tab.
